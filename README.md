a food site I use for html/css practice

from the Udemy course: Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 by Jonas Schmedtmann

I'm also writing these codes while fully practicing emmet

I just learned that Windows Explorer does not natively display svg icon preview so I have to install an extension for that.

The link of ionicons is no longer the same as that in course. The TA has provided an online link for the css but I think this is not a reliable way of making new sites based on the tutorial since links can die. I do have to learn how to implement the same technique for my own projects.
