a food site I use for html/css practice

from the Udemy course: Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 by Jonas Schmedtmann

I'm also writing these codes while fully practicing emmet

I just learned that Windows Explorer does not natively display svg icon preview so I have to install an extension for that.

The CSS link is located at https://ionicons.com/usage. This is needed now and not like the way it is in the tutorial because the page has changed. I did not initially think that the links can be had from the source creator instead of provided by the teacher.

But now I do not know how to get other formats other than this ion-'icon'

Apparently the classes are now here: https://ionicons.com/v2/cheatsheet.html
